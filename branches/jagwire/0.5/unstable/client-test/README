Wonderland Client Test
----------------------

The Wonderland client test is a standalone web application designed to test
if a given computer is capable of running Wonderland, and diagnose problems

web server. Once installed, it can be accessed by url at:

After tests are run, the log can be uploaded to the Wonderland server.
Logs can be accessed by administrators using the "Client Test Logs"
link in the Wonderland Web Administration UI.
