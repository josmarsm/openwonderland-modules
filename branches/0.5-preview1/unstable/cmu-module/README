This module can load scenes from CMU's educational IDE Alice into the
virtual world.

REQUIREMENTS:
The Alice 3 gallery must be placed in a directory called "gallery" in the
top-level directory of this module.  To obtain the gallery, install Alice 3
(http://kenai.com/projects/alice/downloads) on the server to which the
module will be deployed, and copy the "gallery" directory from the Alice 3
install to the module directory.

INSTALLATION:
With a properly configured cmu.module.properties and a running virtual world server,
run 'ant deploy' in the module directory.  From the server administration page on
the web interface, click "edit" on the Server Status page, then "Add Component."
Enter the following:

     Component Name: CMU Runner
     Component Class: org.jdesktop.wonderland.modules.cmu.weblib.CMUPlayerRunner
     Location: Local

Choose OK, then Save.  Restart the server to enable drag and drop of Alice 3
files into the world.
