Wonderland Client Test
----------------------

The Wonderland client test is a standalone web application designed to test
if a given computer is capable of running Wonderland, and diagnose problems
if it is not.

The Wonderland client test installs as a regular module on the Wonderland
web server. Once installed, it can be accessed by url at:

http://<wonderland_server>:<wonderland_port>/client-test/client-test

Clicking on "Launch" will start the test.

After tests are run, the log can be uploaded to the Wonderland server.
Logs can be accessed by administrators using the "Client Test Logs"
link in the Wonderland Web Administration UI.

JAVACV INTEGRATION
------------------

The client-test module depends on the javacv-integration libraries found in
wonderland-modules/unstable.

Please follow the instructions found in javacv-integration/README

REQUIRED CORE CHANGES
---------------------

As of 12/22/2011, a number of core changes are required to Wonderland for
the audio tests to work correctly. It is expected these changes will be
merged into Wonderland core shortly after the new year. In the interim,
use the following steps to update a standard Wonderland source tree
with these changes:

1. change to the wonderland source directory (e.g. ~/0.5-dev/wonderland)

2. copy the diff files from this directory - softphone.diff and 
   voicebridge.diff - into the wonderland directory

3. download the bridge update file from the following URL into the wonderland
   directory:

   https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bw3xjThmUnnpNTdiMDI0ZGItNDJmMC00NmRlLTkyMzEtZWM3Yjk4NDk0Yjhk

4. apply the diffs in the wonderland/ directory:
   
   # patch -p0 < softphone.diff
   # patch -p0 < voicebridge.diff

5. unzip the bridge-update.zip file in the wonderland/ directory, overwriting 
   several libraries:

   # unzip bridge-update.zip

6. rebuild Wonderland and install the client-test module.
