INSTALLATION OF JAVACV.ZIP
<jagwire>

Within the following directories within zip/ you will find javacv.zip:
- win32/
- win64/
- macosx/

In order for the webcam tests found within the client-test project to pass,
you will need to move the javacv.zip of your respective platform into the
wonderland-core/ext/zip/<your-platform> directory. Afterward, you will need
to clean and build your wonderland build. Any questions or comments should
be posted to the openwonderland google group.
