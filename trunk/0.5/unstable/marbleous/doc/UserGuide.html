<p>
Before inserting the marbleous object, turn off Avatar
Collision using <b>Tools&gt;Avatar Collision Response Enabled</b>. Your avatar will
be positioned on the track.
</p>

<h2>Running and Reviewing the Marble Simulation</h2>

<p>
Position your avatar off the track, so that you can see the top of the
beginning of the track, and press the <b>Run</b> button in the Marbleous
Control Panel HUD. Use the CTRL-mouse to change your viewpoint.
One the marble has run down the track (and fallen off the end of the
track), press the Stop button in the HUD. You will be presented with a
time slider HUD.
</p>

<p>
The time slider allows the user to examine the details of the last run
of the marble along the track. The initial state of the slider is time
= 0, i.e. the marble is back at the beginning of the track. By moving
the slider to the right, the position of the marble is updated
according to its last run along the track.
</p>

<p>
Experiment with moving the slider to see the position of marble.
As an example, move the slider so that the marble is about to enter the
upward slope of the loop. Click on the marble, to display details of
the position of the marble, and the time at which it reached this
position. (You may need to move the position of your avatar to get a
good view of this.) Now click on the details: they are expanded to
include additional details of the marble such as it's velocity,
acceleration, potential and kinetic energy. Click again on the details
to see an illustration of the equations that provide the results.
At this stage, you can click again on the details to dismiss them, or
return to the time slider to modify the postion of the marble.
Alternatively, SHIFT-click on the details to cause them to be retained
in position. (The border of the details will turn blue. Should you wish
to dismiss the details, SHIFT click again to remove the blue border.)
Whilst the details are shown with a blue border, adjust the time slider
to show the marble at its peak in the loop, and click on the marble to
show the details of the marble at that position. Click on the details
to reveal extra information and compare the kinetic and potential
energy of the marble when at the peak of the loop with that when it
enters the loop. SHIFT-click on these details so that they are
retained.
</p>

<p>
Now, adjust the time slider so that the marble is just about to leave
the loop and enter the first level segment. Click on the marble to
reveal its details and then click once on those details to expand them.
Now compare the details of the marble in all three positions. Note how
the potential and kinetic energy changes, and how much total energy is
lost by the marble as it goes through the loop.
</p>

<p>
Experiment with the time slider and viewing the details of the marble.
</p>

<h2>Resetting and Re-Running the Simulation</h2>

<p>
Once you have completed reviewing the marble simulation, you should
reset the simulation to its starting state by clicking on the Reset
button in the Marbleous Control Panel HUD. The physics system may also
be reset by checking the <b>Reset Physics</b> check box; if this checkbox is
not selected, consecutive runs of the marble simulation are based on
the results of earlier simulations.
</p>

<h2>Modifying the Track</h2>

<p>
You may modify the track in two ways: adding and removing segments
of track; or editing the properties of a segment of track. We'll cover
each of these in turn. The track should <strong>NOT BE MODIFIED</strong> when the
simulation is running.
</p>

<h2>Adding and Removing Segments of Track</h2>

<p>
To remove a segment of track, select the track segment in the lower
list of track segments of the HUD and click on the <b>Remove</b> button.
To add a segment of track, select a segment type from the upper list of
the HUD and click the Add button. A new segment of track, matching the
selected type, is added to the end of the track.
</p>

<h2>Editing the Properties of a Segment of Track</h2>


<p>To edit the properties of a track segment, first select it from the
lower list of track segments, and then click on the <b>Edit...</b> button. A
new window will appear, titled "Segment Editor". This contains a table
of the "knots" in the segment, plus any other properties of the segment
that may be edited (for example, the Loop has a <em>radius</em> property). The
"knots" of a segment are a mathematical way of describing it, each knot
has the following <a href="http://www.cubic.org/docs/hermite.htm">attributes</a>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tension: How sharply does the curve
bend?</li>
  <li>Continuity: How rapid is the change in speed and direction?
  </li>
  <li>Bias: What is the direction of the curve?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The segment editor presents each segment as a table of knots, with the
rows of the table corresponding to each knot. The user can edit the
values of the knot, including its position, its rotation, tension, bias
and continuity. (Tooltips are provided to hint at the accepted values
for each of these attributes.) Experiment with changing these values,
and click Save when you are done to save your values. If you click the
Restore button, the original values of the segment will be restored.
When you're finished editing, simply close the window.
