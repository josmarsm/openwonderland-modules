INSTALLATION OF JAVACV
<jagwire>
The following files should be moved to your wonderland-core/ext/common directory.
- javacv.jar
- javacpp.jar

Don't forget to edit wonderland-core/build-tools/build-scripts/classpath.xml
to include the path to javacv.jar and javacpp.jar within the
wonderland.lib.classpath section.


INSTALLATION OF JAVACV.ZIP

Within the following directories within zip/ you will find javacv.zip:
- win32/
- win64/
- macosx/

In order for the webcam tests found within the client-test project to pass,
you will need to move the javacv.zip of your respective platform into the
wonderland-core/ext/zip/<your-platform> directory. Afterward, you will need
to clean and build your wonderland build. Any questions or comments should
be posted to the openwonderland google group.
