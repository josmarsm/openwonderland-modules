This module can load scenes from CMU's educational IDE Alice into the
virtual world.

REQUIREMENTS:
The Alice 3 gallery must be placed in a directory called "gallery" in the
top-level directory of this module.  To obtain the gallery, install Alice 3
(http://kenai.com/projects/alice/downloads) on the server to which the
module will be deployed, and copy the "gallery" directory from the Alice 3
install to the module directory.

INSTALLATION:
With a properly configured cmu.module.properties and a running virtual world server,
run 'ant deploy' in the module directory and restart the server.  This installs
the module along with a server component called "CMU Runner," which should start
automatically, and can also be monitored from the Server Status page on the
server web interface.
