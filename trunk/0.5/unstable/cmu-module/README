This module can load scenes from CMU's educational IDE Alice into the
virtual world.

REQUIREMENTS:
The Alice 3 gallery must be placed in a directory called "gallery" in the
top-level directory of this module.  To obtain the gallery, install Alice 3
(http://kenai.com/projects/alice/downloads) on the server to which the
module will be deployed, and copy the directory named "gallery" from the Alice 3
installation directory to the module directory.  Alice 3 can be safely
uninstalled after the gallery is copied.

INSTALLATION:
With a properly configured cmu.module.properties (see the file for more
information on how to configure it) and a running virtual world server,
run 'ant deploy' in the module directory.  Go to the Server Status page
on the web interface (in the Server Administration section), click "edit"
in the top left next to "Server Components", and then choose "Add
Component."  Enter the following:

     Component Name: CMU Runner
     Component Class: org.jdesktop.wonderland.modules.cmu.weblib.CMUPlayerRunner
     Location: Local

Choose OK, then Save.  Restart the server to enable drag and drop of Alice 3
files into the world.
